# Word lists for procedural generation


A pack of `.txt` files containing lists of words.
Some of the proper name wordlists have been (manually) separated into subwords/morphemes for easy mix and match, they are denoted by the suffix `_SW*`


Words for the English language are in `EN`, words for French in `FR`, with a single file in Spanish in `ES` and words not related to any language in `AL` (for any language/aucune langue).

An `example.py` file shows some of the stuff you can do with it

Here are some exampes generated from the world files:
